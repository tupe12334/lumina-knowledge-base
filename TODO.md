# Lumina Knowledge Base - Project TODO

> **Last Updated**: August 16, 2025  
> **Status**: Planning & Implementation Phase

## 🎯 Immediate High Priority Items (This Week)

### 1. Database Seed Performance Optimization

Current seed time: ~100 seconds → Target: <30 seconds (70% improvement)

Impact: HIGH | Effort: MEDIUM | Status: In Progress

#### Quick Wins (Phase 1) - Week 1

- [ ] **Replace individual upserts with bulk operations**
  - Move 60+ hardcoded translations from `seed.ts` to `prisma/seed/translations.consts.ts`
  - Convert individual translation upserts to bulk `createMany` operations
  - Files to modify: `seed.ts`, `questions.seed.ts`, `degree.seed.ts`, `modules.seed.ts`

- [ ] **Implement batch entity lookups**

```typescript
// Current: Individual findFirst calls
const courseTranslation = await prisma.translation.findFirst({
  where: { en_text: courseName },
});

// Target: Batch all translations at once
const courseTranslations = await prisma.translation.findMany({
  where: { en_text: { in: courseNames } },
});
const translationMap = new Map(courseTranslations.map((t) => [t.en_text, t]));
```

### 2. API Error Handling & Validation Enhancement

Impact: HIGH | Effort: LOW | Status: Pending

- [ ] **Add centralized error handling middleware**
  - Implement global exception filter for NestJS
  - Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes
  - Error logging and monitoring integration

- [ ] **Enhanced input validation**
  - Improve GraphQL input validation with better error messages
  - Add request validation middleware for REST endpoints
  - Implement rate limiting and security hardening

### 3. Test Coverage & Quality Assurance

Impact: MEDIUM | Effort: LOW | Status: Good Foundation

- [ ] **Add integration tests for GraphQL endpoints**
- [ ] **Implement E2E tests for critical user journeys**
- [ ] **Set up test coverage reporting and CI/CD integration**

### 4. Environment Variable Validation Hardening

Impact: HIGH | Effort: LOW | Status: Pending

- [ ] Adopt a single source of truth for env configuration using Zod with strict parsing and sensible defaults (keep functions <50 LOC)
- [ ] Add support for `NODE_ENV`, strict `PORT` range, boolean coercion for flags, and robust CORS origin parsing
- [ ] Provide a small `loadEnv(source?: NodeJS.ProcessEnv)` function for testability and export a frozen `env` value
- [ ] Add unit tests in `src/env/index.spec.ts` for: defaults, invalid `PORT`, boolean flags, and CORS parsing
- [ ] Fail fast in bootstrap on invalid env; keep imports absolute and avoid type casts

## 📋 Medium Priority (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### Database & Performance Optimization

#### Phase 2: Parallel Processing - Week 2

- [ ] **Analyze seed dependencies and implement parallel execution**

```typescript
// Target: Parallel independent operations
await Promise.all([
  seedUniversities(tx),
  seedFaculties(tx),
  seedDisciplines(tx), // If independent of faculties
]);
```

- [ ] **Smart Caching Strategy**
  - ✅ Create `SeedCache` class (Already implemented)
  - ✅ Integrate cache into seed functions (Already implemented)

#### Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience - Week 3

- [ ] **Progress tracking & monitoring utilities**
- [ ] **Graceful error handling and recovery mechanisms**

### API & Architecture Improvements

- [ ] **Implement caching strategy** for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Add monitoring/logging** for production readiness
- [ ] **Optimize GraphQL queries** with DataLoader pattern
- [ ] **API documentation improvements** and OpenAPI enhancements

---

## 🔧 Advanced Optimizations (4-8 Weeks)

### Phase 4: Advanced Database Optimizations - Week 4

- [ ] **Split large seedQuestions function** (currently 200+ lines)
- [ ] **Implement raw SQL for bulk relationship operations**
- [ ] **Advanced question seeding with preprocessing**

### Phase 5: Infrastructure & Maintenance - Week 5

- [ ] **Database connection optimization**
- [ ] **Environment-specific seeding strategies**
- [ ] **Incremental seeding for faster development cycles**

### Phase 6-8: Advanced Folder Structure & Flow Optimizations

- [ ] **Hierarchical folder organization** for seed files
- [ ] **Execution Flow DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) implementation
- [ ] **Smart execution engine** with parallel processing
- [ ] **Streaming data processing** for large datasets
- [ ] **Performance monitoring & analytics dashboard**

## 📊 Success Metrics & Targets

### Performance Targets

- **Current**: ~100 seconds seed time
- **Phase 1 Target**: <30 seconds (70% improvement)
- **Phase 4 Target**: <10 seconds (90% improvement)

### Quality Metrics

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% code coverage
- [ ] **API Response Time**: <200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] **Error Rate**: <1% for production endpoints
- [ ] **Build Time**: <2 minutes for full CI/CD pipeline

## 🏗️ Code Quality & Architecture Standards

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles

- ✅ Modular structure with domain separation
- ✅ Each module has its own folder with controllers, services, entities
- [ ] Improve error handling patterns across modules
- [ ] Standardize validation approaches

### Testing Strategy

- ✅ Unit tests in same folder as code with `.spec.ts` suffix
- ✅ Vitest for fast unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests for all major workflows
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user paths
- [ ] Performance regression testing

## 🔍 Current Pain Points & Technical Debt

### Database Seeding Issues

1. **60+ individual translation upserts** in main seed file
2. **Nested loops with individual database calls** in questions.seed.ts
3. **Sequential processing** of independent operations
4. **Repeated entity lookups** without caching
5. **Large monolithic functions** (seedQuestions: 200+ lines)

### Architecture Improvements Needed

- [ ] Centralized configuration management
- [ ] Standardized error response formats
- [ ] Consistent logging patterns
- [ ] Performance monitoring integration
- [ ] Security audit and hardening

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] Maintain idempotency (safe to run multiple times)
- [ ] Preserve referential integrity
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Include unit tests for optimization functions
- [ ] Keep functions under 50 lines of code
- [ ] Use absolute imports without file extensions

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test each phase independently
- [ ] Verify data integrity after optimizations
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] Test in different environments

### Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Keep original seed functions as fallback
- [ ] Implement feature flags for optimizations
- [ ] Add rollback procedures for each phase
- [ ] Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## 📝 Notes & Dependencies

### Seed Dependencies Chain

- Universities → Faculties → Disciplines → Courses → Degrees
- Translations must exist before entities that reference them
- Blocks must exist before courses and modules
- Modules must exist before questions

### Technology Stack

- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Monorepo System**: turbo
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **Database**: Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Linting**: ESLint
